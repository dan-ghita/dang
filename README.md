# dang

 Single-page web IDE for a new programming language called Dang, allowing users to write and execute scripts in a web client, compilation and execution being then handled on the server using abstract syntax trees and state machine evaluation. The IDE itself provides static analysis over the code, syntax highlighting, code completion and formatting, as well as file management.
